  <h2>Welcome to My Journey</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Tullis, a beginner software developer and solo indie game creator. This site is my personal space to share my projects, 
    progress, and everything I'm learning along the way. Whether you're curious about how to get started in development or just like to see behind-the-scenes of someone figuring it all out, 
    you're in the right place.</p>

  <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
  <p>People always ask how you break into coding or start making games. I figured the best way to answer that was to show them. 
    This site is my portfolio and works in progress. After I complete major projects, they will be added here! 
    I wanted a place to keep track of what I’ve built and share it with others who might be on a similar path or just curious.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  <p>I’ll show off my personal projects (like platformers and puzzle games), talk about the tools I’m learning 
    (C++, Unreal Engine, Python), and give updates as I improve. My main goal is to be real and honest about the learning process—what works, what fails, and what’s fun.</p>
