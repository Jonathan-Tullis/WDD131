      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m Jonathan Tullis. I’m learning to become a Game Developer and 3D Artist, and in my free time, 
        I like to make indie games. My personal website will show the projects I’ve worked on, like games I’m creating and even 3D models that I am working on. 
        It’s a place where I can share my progress, what I’m learning, and what I’m excited about. I want it to be simple, easy to explore, and a way for others to see what I can do. 
        If you’ve ever been curious about how someone gets started with game development and 3D modeling, this site will give you a real look at the process.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This site is made for anyone curious about 3D Art, Game Development, or Indie Game Design. 
        It’s especially for students, new developers, or recruiters looking to understand what I can do. 
        Most visitors will be between 16–35 years old and want to explore my personal projects or connect with a self-starting developer. 
        I want them to browse my portfolio and learn about my process or even reach out.
      </p>
      <h3>Dynamic Elements & JavaScript Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        This website will use JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging user experience. Here's how I plan to implement dynamic functionality:
      </p>
      
      <h4>1. Project Filtering System (Projects Page)</h4>
      <p>
        DOM Manipulation & Events: I'll create an interactive filter system where users can click category buttons (Game Development, 3D Art, All Projects) to dynamically show/hide projects. 
        JavaScript will select all project cards using <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>, listen for click events on filter buttons, and toggle CSS classes to show/hide projects based on their category data attribute.
      </p>
      
      <h4>2. Project Data Management (ES Modules & Objects)</h4>
      <p>
        Objects & ES Modules: Project data (title, description, image, category, tools used, date) will be stored in an array of objects in a separate <code>projects.js</code> module. 
        This module will be imported into the main script, and the <code>renderProjects()</code> function will use <code>Array.map()</code> to generate HTML for each project card dynamically.
      </p>
      
      <h4>3. Image Modal/Lightbox (Conditional Branching)</h4>
      <p>
        Conditional Logic & DOM Interaction: When users click on a project image, JavaScript will check if a modal already exists using an <code>if/else</code> statement. 
        If not, it will create a modal element dynamically, display the full-size image, and add a close button. Clicking outside the modal or on the close button will remove it from the DOM.
      </p>
      
      <h4>4. Contact Form Validation (Home Page)</h4>
      <p>
        Event Listeners & Validation: The contact form will use JavaScript to validate user input before submission. 
        An event listener on the form's submit event will prevent default submission, check if fields are filled using conditional statements, 
        and display error messages or success confirmation dynamically by modifying the DOM.
      </p>
      
      <h4>5. Dark Mode Toggle (All Pages)</h4>
      <p>
        DOM Manipulation & Local Storage: A toggle button in the header will switch between light and dark themes. 
        JavaScript will add/remove a "dark-mode" class on the body element using <code>classList.toggle()</code>, 
        and save the user's preference in localStorage so it persists across page visits.
      </p>
      
      <h4>6. Animated Project Counter (Home Page)</h4>
      <p>
        Array Methods: The homepage will display "X Projects Completed" with an animated counting effect. 
        JavaScript will use <code>Array.filter()</code> to count completed projects from the project data array, 
        then animate the number counting up using <code>setInterval()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Summary: This site will demonstrate organization through multiple functions and modules, 
        extensive DOM interaction (selecting, modifying, creating elements), event handling (clicks, form submission), 
        conditional branching (validation, modal checks), and array methods (map, filter, forEach) to manage and display project data dynamically.
      </p>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <strong>Welcome to My Journey</strong>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Jonathan Tullis, a beginner Game Developer and 3D Artist.
        This site is my personal space to share my projects, progress, and everything I'm learning along the way. 
        Whether you're curious about how to get started in development or just like to see behind-the-scenes of someone figuring it all out, you're in the right place.
      </p>

      <strong>Why I Built This Site</strong>
      <p>
        People always ask how you start making games. 
        I figured the best way to answer that was to show them. This site is my open journal—my portfolio, sandbox, and devlog all in one.
        I wanted a place to keep track of what I’ve built and share it with others who might be on a similar path or just curious.
      </p>

      <strong>What You'll Find Here</strong>
      <p>
        I’ll show off my personal projects (like platformers and puzzle games), talk about the tools I’m learning (Blender, Unity, Adobe etc), 
        and give updates as I improve. My main goal is to be real and honest about the learning process—what works, what fails, and what’s fun.
      </p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <strong>My Indie Game Projects</strong>
      <p>
        This page shows off my current and past game projects. Most are built in Unreal Engine or Unity, 
        and they reflect a mix of creativity and experimentation. You’ll see screenshots, descriptions, what tech I used, and where to play them if they’re available online.
      </p>

      <strong>Project Development Logs</strong>
      <p>
        For each game, I like to break down the development steps. I’ll walk through challenges I hit (bugs, scope creep, design issues), 
        and how I solved them. This gives anyone following along a transparent look into what it’s really like to build something solo.
      </p>

      <strong>Future Goals</strong>
      <p>
        Some games are works in progress. I’ll share what I plan to add or fix and ask for feedback when I can. 
        My dream is to keep evolving these ideas into something people enjoy playing. This site will track that process.
      </p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <strong>How I Got Into Dev</strong>
      <p>
        I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially tech and games. A few years ago, 
        I started learning the Unity game engine, and that turned into building simple games. Now I’m studying software development seriously, and working on side projects all the time.
      </p>

      <strong>What I’m Learning</strong>
      <p>
        Right now, I’m focused on learning Blender, playing with different game engines to find one I like, 
        and exploring how design and code come together to make good experiences. I don’t know everything yet, but I love the process of figuring it out.
      </p>

      <strong>Let’s Connect</strong>
      <p>
        If you’re a developer, gamer, or someone just starting outreach out! I’m always down to connect and collaborate. 
        You can use the contact links on the site or follow me through the projects I share here.
